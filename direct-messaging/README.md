## The APIs used

### `Chat.intercept()`

We use this API to intercept chat messages that start with `/dm @`.
Once intercepted, we remove `/dm`, resolve the name of the user (the `@` something), send we send him/her the rest of the message in private.

Find out more about this API [here](https://developers.livestorm.co/docs/chat#intercept).

### `Chat.send()`

We use this API to send a message in the Chat whenever someone sends a DM.
We combine this API with the PubSub API in order to publish the message only to the correct recipient.

Find out more about this API [here](https://developers.livestorm.co/docs/chat#send).

### `PubSub`

We use this API to dispatch private messages via Websockets between attendees.
Everyone `subscribe()` to their own messaging channel (`dm-to-${me.id}`), then whenever a DM is sent, it is dispatched only to the channel corresponding to the recipient (ex: `dm-to-1235`). 

Find out more about this API [here](https://developers.livestorm.co/docs/pubsub).

### `Chat.Buttons.registerChatShareButton()`

We use this API to register a button in the (+) menu of the Chat, allowing the user to prefill the `<textarea>` with the correct command.

Find out more about this API [here](https://developers.livestorm.co/docs/chat#buttonsregisterchatsharebutton).

### `Users.me()`

We use the `Users` API to retrieve the information associated with the current user. This is used to subscribe to messages published to the ID of the connected user.
