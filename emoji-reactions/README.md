## The APIs used

### `Chat.send()`

First, the plugin sends a message in the chat to the moderators of the event.

This message includes a custom template and allows to activate the plugin, preview an emoji reaction and dismiss the message.

#### `PubSub.subscribe()` & `Pubsub.publish()`

This is probably the most important API within this plugin. 
To display the emoji reaction to everyone in the Room, we use the `PubSub` API in order to subscribe and to publish to an event.

Whenever someone clicks on a reaction, we publish a message which everyone receives, and this triggers the Emoji Reaction.
We also use it to automatically hide the above Chat message whenever a moderator activates the emoji reactions.

#### `Storage.setItem()` & `Storage.getItem()`

These APIs allows the plugin to know whether the emoji reaction was previously activated on an event. 
That way, we know if we have to automatically display the buttons and the message when we enter the room.

#### `NotificationCenter.showIframe()`

This API is used to display the actual CSS animation within an HTML template.

#### `Stage.Buttons.registerStageButton()`

This API is used to display the emoji reaction button on the stage whenever emoji reactions are activated.

#### `When.eventEnds()`

We use this API to display a Chat message right when the events ends, this allow us to get some feedback from the moderators regarding the use of the plugin.

#### `Configuration`

We use the `Configuration` API to get some data such as the session ID for tracking purposes, and also to get the language of the event in order to display translated strings.
